# mocha-chai-demo
A meandering attempt to learn these JavaScript testing tools.<br/><br/><br/>

##Goals:
Create a simple HTML form, and the validation functions that would typically go along with it.<br/><br/>


Construct unit tests for JavaScript & CoffeeScript files and their functions.<br/><br/>


Find a way to run these test using a single command line call.<br/><br/>


Find a way to have that command line call work for files and functions not preceded by the module keyword "exports"<br/><br/>

Figure out how to implement code coverage tools.<br/><br/>
